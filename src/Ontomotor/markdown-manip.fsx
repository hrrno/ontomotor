// Loading and manipulating Markdown files
// Baseline functionality for file manip to be fed into the TypeProvider



// Load the file

// Grab the props

    // Headers at all levels
        // "incorrect" indentation (ie H4 under H2), should be amalgomated as though it were of an appropriate header
        // eg H1 -> H2 -> H4 & H3 should present like H1 -> H2 -> H3 & H3
        // eg # Foo; ## Bar; #### Baz; ### Zab => Foo.Bar.Baz & Foo.Bar.Zab

    // Loose content 
        // Create an .InnerText prop that lets you dump all content including autoprops
        // Collect all content that isnt in props as .Content (?)
        // Handle missing loose content by returning ""

    // Properties within each section
        // Parse dates, bools, ints, decimal numbers, 

    // List the props detected / the documents schema
        // the files should be able to report on their own structure
            // YAML front matter
            // YAML in subsections?
            // headers and content divisions
        // provide some means of schema validation
            // Doc.MatchesSchema (schema)



// Load files as a collection
    // Provide a unified type for all files in the collection for loops
    // Perhaps add a downcast operator to get the raw, unrestricted, manifestation of the file?
        // ie GroupObj.Explicit runs the provider on a single file, with only those props...
